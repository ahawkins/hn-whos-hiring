    need is for a contractor to assist in building out a hypermedia API for an ongoing

    mysql, redis, and node.js.  The core need is for someone who is comfortable writing
    in a modern JS style (async/await, unit and bdt, etc), who avoids slow and unsafe
    patterns with SQL, and who has some experience with docker, ssh, git, and so forth.<p>Familiarity
    with any of JSON Hypermedia, OAuth2, AWS administration, microservices, Ansible,

    weeks, though number of hours for each week may vary.  We plan to get started
    in February, so the decision process should be short.<p>As mentioned, we will
    be setting up a physical office in SC in 2018; for a developer located in the

    We''ve started two new companies in the last year and we''re currently working
    on two more. The plan is to do this about four times a year.<p>We operate under
    a unique structure here. We bring in a few types of people -<p>EIR''s (disclosure:
    I am one of those here) These are typically people we believe can start a company
    and run it taking it the distance as founder/CEO''s.<p>Company Builders - These
    are people who have a deep interest in joining a company very early (in the idea
    iteration phase) either as an early employee or a co-founder<p>HVF Core Staff
    - These are the people who help the companies coming out of HVF succeed.<p>So
    far we''ve seen Yelp, Affirm, Glow and Divvy Homes publicly announce their launch
    and as mentioned there are a couple more in the pipeline.<p>One of the major bonuses
    about being here is getting to work with brilliant people.<p>Ben Jun who runs
    HVF is literally the guy who discovered a side channel attack that allowed people
    to exploit the voltage output of a Credit Card chip to decrypt the card number.
    Don''t worry he also helped fix it!<p>It''s an environment like no other I''ve
    been a part of and we''re constantly looking for smart people who love iterating
    on ideas to join us and help us build something real and meaningful.<p>It doesn''t
    hurt we get to hang out with people like Ben and Max on a regular basis too.<p>If
    this sounds interesting ping me and I''ll be happy to have you by or tell you
    more!<p>zach@hvflabs.com'

    they involves two very different mindsets.<p>Networking is great for people who
    are very interested in learning how to operate things. They want to get to know
    how to use things in the world to their advantage and find ways to make them do
    useful things in concert.<p>A programmer has to think more about how to get new,
    undiscovered or previously unimplemented behavior out of a system and do so reliably.<p>Network
    engineers need to do that at a large scale as a small aspect - like when a network
    goes completely down and no one knows why. You have to discover how things are
    supposed to work, why they're not working, and how to get them to work again -
    that's support. They also have to be able to design at a large scale and understand
    pre-built connection templates (i.e. protocols) and follow them. And they need
    to be responsible for hundreds of customers access to information, utilities,
    and the business.<p>We look for engineers with college degrees in sciences and
    technology. Promenet has 20 years of experience, with focuses in security, networking,
    systems, consulting, infrastructure managed services, and other high-level IT
    services. Named CRN Pioneer 250 for MSP 5 years running. Servicing 85% of New

    Snapsheet (Car Insurance) | Full-time | ONSITE | Chicago, IL<p>We work with the car insurance industry to provide a better claims process for drivers, shops, and carriers. If you've seen a commercial where someone takes out an app after a car accident, they're probably one of our clients. The company is currently in a strong growth phase and just moved to a new larger office, with a focus on controlled rather than hyper growth. Many of our clients are fortune 500 companies, but we're still relatively small with around 300 employees, about half of which work remotely. We're the industry leader in self-service
    claims.<p>Our core stack is React+Rails hosted on AWS/Heroku, but there's plenty of other smaller projects in other languages and stacks and of course our Android and iPhone apps. Our primary product is an internal CRM, but as mentioned it's supported by other more focused ones such as tools for body shops or car rental services.<p>One of the things I think worth highlighting is bi-weekly hack days, which actually produce things we deploy to production or use as a foundation for other projects rather than sitting on
    a local branch gathering dust. We're hiring for just about any role or background, including data science and design.<p>Check out our information/marketing page at <a href="http://www.snapsheetapp.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapsheetapp.com/careers</a> and available positions at <a href="http://careers.snapsheetapp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://careers.snapsheetapp.com/</a>.

    for its first non-technical + growth-focused hire. The goal with this position
    is to help generate early traction, which means it will start with a bit of creative
    marketing efforts, likely continue with some sales, and end with some Customer
    Success (contingent upon success of the first two areas, of course). We are looking
    for someone to help out across the board, so you should be a generalist and a
    bit of a hustler.<p>Vitally is a product analytics platform (with revenue analytics
    coming soon) to drive success for B2B startups - think Mixpanel meets Baremetrics
    with a focus exclusively on B2B needs/pains. We did the Techstars NYC accelerator
    last fall and will launch our first official offering in April.<p>If you want
    to join a promising startup in its (very) early stages, please reach out to jamie@vitally.io.
    Thanks!

    Who we are: We are a small company loathe to use the word “startup”. The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.<p>Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.<p>Technologies:<p>NodeJS / JavaScript<p>Babel / ES6<p>RDMS: MySQL / Postgres<p>Amazon Web Services: EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, S3<p>GitHub<p>Apache Aurora / Mesos<p>Terraform<p>Docker<p>We’re open to new technologies too, in the right situation.<p><a href="https://www.builtforme.tech" rel="nofollow">https://www.builtforme.tech</a><p><a href="https://blog.builtforme.tech" rel="nofollow">https://blog.builtforme.tech</a><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href="https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a>

    Jackbox Games | Chicago, IL | Onsite | Full-time<p>I'm hiring a person to join me in running the infrastructure at Jackbox Games. We make party games like Quiplash, Fibbage, and You Don't Know Jack. Here's a gameplay example from when Jimmy Fallon played Quiplash on his show: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTe6yVbM2Ks" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTe6yVbM2Ks</a><p>Our infrastructure team right now is, er, me. I could use a hand running the multiplayer servers. The servers themselves are socket.io servers written in node, but I'm transitioning them to Go. Players play our games from a web app on their phones, which acts as the controller. The controller and the game consoles both connect to a server, which is really a glorified messaging proxy. Most of our games are designed for up to 8 players, some more, some less. Many of our games support live audiences of up to 10,000 people; some popular streamers stream our games on Twitch so that their streaming audience can participate in the games, and our games are played at public events (football halftimes, for example).<p>I'm the lead engineer on the multiplayer server application and the lead devops person. A few of the other engineers pitch in a few hours a week with the servers but I'm the only person working on the server infrastructure full time. We're hoping to find someone to help us continue to evolve the multiplayer server application and share the devops work. We have a handful of ancillary web apps to run, like asset-generating servers, a shopping cart app, and an internal CMS that we use for managing game assets. Redis, AWS, Terraform, Chef, node.js, golang, blah blah blah, we use those things and some other things, too.<p>Here's the job description:

    | $80-$100k<p>Stan (<a href=\"http://mc-stan.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mc-stan.org</a>)
    is an open source probabilistic programming language and Bayesian inference toolkit
    that data scientists and applied statisticians across the world and many fields
    use to specify statistical models and fit them to data. Stan emerged from the
    research group under Andrew Gelman at Columbia, which is focused on state-of-the-art
    in Bayesian inference methodology and consulted on a variety of statistical problems
    in the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, sports, and business.
    Since its initial release, we’ve welcomed collaborators and contributors across
    the globe and have about 30 active contributors at the time of writing.<p>We’re
    looking for a tools and infrastructure developer who is interested in science
    and open source, is a self-starter and intrinsically motivated to help out, wants
    a flexible lifestyle, and would like to learn Bayesian stats and data analysis.
    Ideally you’d come in knowing a decent amount about either systems administration
    or programming (or both) and we would teach you about statistics. We’re looking
    for help with the following problems initially:\n* Streamlining installation for
    our R and Python interfaces for scientists on Windows and Mac, perhaps creating
    installers for each platform\n* Maintaining and improving our continuous integration
    infrastructure (currently Jenkins, Travis, AWS)\n* Bringing the PyStan interface
    up to feature parity with RStan and improving both of them (Python)\n* Higher
    order autodiff test framework and infrastructure (C++)<p>We expect that you will
    need to spend a significant portion of your time on at least some of these problems
    at first. Beyond that, there is much work to be done on Stan as an ecosystem.
    For example, we could also use help with the following key underserved areas of
    the project:\n* Profiling and performance benchmarks and improvements\n* Various
    refactorings, mostly in C++ \n* Pedagogical materials\n* GPU and distributed computation
    support<p>There are also many other ways to improve Stan that could use helping
    hands:\n* Stan 3.0 language and/or compiler rewrite\n* CloudStan\n* Graphical
    modeling language transpiler\n* New algorithm research implementations\n* Anything

    data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately,
    maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting
    via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business
    development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big
    aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At

    auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency
    in this process.<p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers

    for lambda functions.<p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse

    Wildcard is building an alternative to traditional banks, mobile only, and with products - not just UI - designed for those under 30, by people who are under 30. We're the sort of company that does actually give a fuck about inequality, that experiments with things like open salaries, and believes revenue is the best indicator of traction. We've just raised a series A round, have our embarrassing MVP in the app store, and are looking to build out an engineering team to take the load off the founders.<p>This early in the process we're all about culture, so we're looking for locals who can work mostly from the office, but if you think you can persuade us it's worth going a different way, we're open to the conversation.<p>We have three immediate needs, in native iOS, backend (Rails), and product design.

    team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up
    members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our
    infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We
    write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process
    for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues
    with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our
    in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We’re
    looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and
    who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over
    convincing the group they’re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect

    boards and a professional social network focused on the almost 3/4 of the country
    that doesn't have a four-year college degree. We're growing quickly, with 80MM
    registered members, and are mostly self-funded to 100+ employees, so we're highly
    focused on data-driven decisions and making smart capacity investments for the
    future. We're one of Boston Business Journal's Best Places to Work (again!).<p>Recruiting
    for multiple roles, especially:<p><i>Platform engineer (including technical lead)</i>
    - Build all our core systems (including interesting architecture/scaling problems),
    working on a well-documented code base in a team with a strong review culture
    and very clear communications. We use a Java/Hibernate stack; happy to get applications
    from people with experience in comparable technologies.<p><i>Front-end engineer</i>
    - Build all our member-facing applications including Jobcase.com, working mostly
    in Ruby on Rails. Drive the member experience for acquisition and social network
    features, working closely with product management and design/UX.<p><i>Quantitative
    data analyst</i> - Own a slice of our business metrics and drive member acquisition
    and engagement. Send email/SMS communications, work with engineering to build
    new flows and features, and come up with experiments to optimize the member experience.<p><i>Data
    science / machine learning / information retrieval (experienced) </i> - Help our
    members find relevant advice and jobs, and our colleagues make good decisions.
    Have a direct impact on revenue and on engagement, working with a team that's
    making major optimizations for our members and with colleagues who are uniformly
    data-savvy.<p>Interview process is a phone screen, then onsite interviews, with
    onsite design exercise and/or take-home coding/analysis exercise. Happy to answer
    questions, jberk at jobcase.com - my team works pretty closely with all of those
    teams.<p><a href="http://www.jobcase.com/locations/4Od3KKqq7pBUVSLdOt5YCwfo/nzrsagNgjg18QzdOKcLpbpvq/jobcase-cambridge-201-broadway/apply"

    or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours --
    you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement
    there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else
    the training/time investment doesn''t make as much sense from your end or ours.
    When each interview is done, you''re done.<p>I know the above might sound a little
    strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup
    that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily
    first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction
    of their engineers'' time interviewing; we help take the load off. We''ve done
    a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could
    write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with
    us, clients love working with us, and we''re well-funded and growing quickly as
    a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we''re looking to hire more
    Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written
    and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience.
    Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training
    you before you even start, so if you''re strong technically and love working with
    people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat,
    using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers
    who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top
    tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to
    work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road
    tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero
    to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather''s like.<p>The
    application form is here: <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&lever-source=HNWH"

    me at josh@karat.io and I''m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S. We''re also
    hiring for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior engineers, dev
    managers, and a product manager right now; for those we generally prefer local
    (Seattle) candidates, though we do cover relocation. More details on those here:

    Lightning Labs, we scale blockchains. Our current focus is the development and
    deployment of the Lightning Network[1], an open blockchain scalability protocol[2]
    primarily being developed for Bitcoin. Lightning allows for high volume, low fee,
    instant payments on top of Bitcoin. We strive to continually push the edge of
    innovation w.r.t blockchain scalability, advanced privacy-preserving smart contracts,
    and cryptocurrency UX. Amongst our team include applied cryptographers, the designers
    of the Lightning Network protocol, and several Bitcoin developers making key contributions
    to the open source Bitcoin eco-system such as roasbeef[3].<p>Cryto Protocol Engineer

    Lightning Network, neutrino[5] an advanced lite client operating mode for Bitcoin,
    conduct novel research into cryptocurrencies (and related areas), and helping
    to design the next generation of smart contract applications on Bitcoin.<p>Frontend
    Developer:<p>Our work on the second-layer of blockchains presents a number of
    UI/UX challenges, as we lift traditional wallets to the next layer creating a

    the way the world builds software. We mean it.<p>We value aptitude over alma mater,
    empathy over a list of APIs. It doesn''t matter whether your resumé says PHP or
    PhD: if you''re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We
    have many offices worldwide including SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto (pivotal.io/locations)
    and more coming. We''re broken into two main divisions: Pivotal Labs (<i>that</i>
    Pivotal Labs) and R&D.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better
    at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We
    pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers
    are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from
    users to pixels. The goal is to teach the teachers. Our engineers pair with client
    engineers, often we pair designers and product managers as well.<p>Not many people
    get to transform how people think and work. Why not you?<p>-- <i>R&D</i> is a
    big tent these days, encompassing two major cloud platforms (Pivotal Application
    Service & Pivotal Container Service), Pivotal Tracker, Spring Framework, Greenplum,
    Apache HAWQ (incubating), Gemfire / Apache Geode, BOSH and Concourse CI. We''re
    adding Pivotal Function Service this year. We dogfood the cutting edge of our
    technology on our own commercial cloud, Pivotal Web Services, run by our awesome
    CloudOps team. We''re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project and
    we''re a platinum CNCF member with rapidly-growing contributions to the k8s ecosystem.
    There is a lot happening right now and there are greenfield platform opportunities.<p>Not
    many people get to work on or work with such systems. Why not you?<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At
    our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and
    competitive pay. Ping pong isn''t mandatory, but it''s popular. I think west-coast
    ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.
    The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that''s life in paradise.<p>--

    if you have questions. I won''t reply to copypasta. I may not be able to reply
    immediately, as I am just an engineer here. These help me earn a referral bonuses,

Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!<p>Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news.

You’ll grasp our strategic vision, consult with stakeholders to prioritise and specify desired developments, and co-ordinate the work of our agile development team to balance our editorial, development and commercial goals and deliver them with maximum efficiency.<p>- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript, CSS3, SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.<p>- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.<p>- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.<p>- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.<p>- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.<p>All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
    All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.<p>If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. <a href="http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/</a>

Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it.

  text: 'Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA - Full Stack Engineer, Infrastructure
    Engineer, Mobile Engineer<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are
    Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to
    read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome
    work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you
    fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches.
    But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even
    when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright
    sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need
    you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug
    reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>-
    A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust,
    rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in
    a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the
    most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and
    night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either:
    every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while
    having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal
    and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to
    go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work
    at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to
    figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might
    bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven
    data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some
    new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant
    in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>-
    Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!).
    You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is
    always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch
    on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL
    — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can
    just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know
    what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more,
    but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying.
    That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard
    and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other
    applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first
    favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally
    overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to
    do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which
    you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com" rel="nofollow">http://we.are.expensify.com</a>)
    or email us at jobs@expensify.com. We are excited to hear from you!'

    optile in Munich, Germany (noremote (well, a little bit of remote work is already possible), fulltime) - Java, React.JS, Internal IT Sysadmin<p><a href="https://www.optile.net/en/company/job-offers/" rel="nofollow">https://www.optile.net/en/company/job-offers/</a><p>optile is creating an open payment gateway that solves the pain involved in taking international payments and taking a lot of different payment methods in many different countries. We do this through a REST/JSON API, a well thought-out architecture and intricate knowledge of the payment systems that govern all of our life. We are growing fast and are executing a huge opportunity for the company with a number of big name customers now in the pipeline.<p>We have a very diverse team (over 20 nationalities) consisting of 50+ people.<p>I (the person posting this) have just recently taken on the
    responsibility of CTO and was positively surprised by the culture I already found in the existing team. I am now continuing to foster it. optile is firmly based on mutual respect, hiring smart people and getting out of their way (aka taking responsibility), honest feedback and transparency. Work here is challenging, but also fun and I personally focus on creating a team of happy humans who build great software. We pay competitive wages and have a good track record of providing incentives through equity for all employees. There are free soft drinks, beer, coffee and fruit.<p>We do have remote positions available in building payment method adapters, as the adapter team is the one that has most experience and the cultural tenets to work remotely, but the core team and the company is still local to Munich. One thing can lead to another, though.<p>That said, we are looking for:
    - Java developers of all kinds (junior, senior, you name it). The adapter developer position mentioned above needs more of a "senior" profile.
    - ReactJS/Redux/ReactNative developers (junior, senior, you name it)
    - Internal IT Administrator (preferably a generalist with an interest in everything and experience in structuring heterogeneous systems and herding cats)
    - Quality Assurance Lead (big focus on automation, but also taking a holistic view of the end-to-end product experience)<p>We are also looking for candidates in "not typically HackerNews" positions. We have openings for working students and in marketing and sales.<p>Experience with MongoDB, Spring, PostgreSQL, Lodash, D3.js, Vertx, perhaps a little bit of OSGi (yeah, we know, we're moving away from it), a good understanding of cryptography, previous payment experience, risk models and machine learning are all a plus.<p>If anything of the above sounds good to you, please click the above link and send us your CV :).

    | Growth Strategy for YC co's | We train you | $85,000/yr USD or $105,000/yr CAD
    | Remote (US or Canada)<p>---<p>Teaser: We're eventually moving to a 4-day workweek.
    And you get to work from home on day one.<p>---<p>The role: Helping Y Combinator
    companies refine their user acquisition and conversion optimization strategy.
    So they get more users. Who stick around longer and pay more. We have a moat of
    data and tactics that make us the best. Which is why big startups work with us
    for so long.<p><pre><code>  - Who we are: BellCurve.com is the top startup growth
    agency in SF. We grow mostly YC startups.\n  - Clients include: Envoy, Clearbit,
    and Sentry. Plus a dozen more.\n  - Our team: 6 engineers turned marketers. \n
    \ - Approach: We emphasize data — not brand voice. We care about conversion —
    not brand marketing. \n  - Prior knowledge: We will teach you everything about
    advanced growth tactics.\n</code></pre>\nWe need someone who already:<p><pre><code>
    \ - → Is personable and can bond with others over phone calls. This has to be
    a strength of yours.\n  - → Is a strong writer.\n  - → Has worked for at least
    1 funded startup. Can't be brand new to startup life. (No interns.)\n  - (If you're
    introverted and don't say much on a call, you won't be a good fit for this role.)\n
    \ - Is concerned about process and being efficient with their time. Automate,
    delegate, batch. \n  - Lets data decide instead of exclusively relying on hunches.\n
    \ - Is passionate about a long-term future in growth marketing (aka growing startups).\n
    \ - Is able to quickly connect dots and come up with creative strategies on the
    spot.\n</code></pre>\nWe operate unlike a typical agency. (I wish there were a
    better term than \"agency.\") We work with clients for a long time; we see them
    from start to finish. You'll get a front-row seat to some of the most interesting
    companies. We have a profound impact on our clients' businesses and product roadmaps.
    They listen to us. Because we have built a moat of data and tactics that others
    have not figured out. (I personally learned a lot from previously running growth
    for Heap and Webflow.)<p>I have a hunch that A) operations/product leads, B) sociable
    engineers, and C) salespeople looking for something more than sales calls will
    be a great fit for this role.<p>How to apply:<p><pre><code>  - → Email me (Julian
    Shapiro): jobs [at] bellcurve.com\n  - → Kindly link me to your LinkedIn or attach
    a resume :)\n  - Please note you must have experience working at a funded startup.\n
    \ - You must live in the US or Canada.\n  - If you're a fit, I will respond same-day
    and we'll hop on a call together.\n</code></pre>\nI will look at every application
    very closely.<p>---<p>More about me (Julian):<p><pre><code>  - My growth interview

    build web products in three main areas:<p>1) A platform that integrates (leverages
    Magnolia, AEM) to build a headless CMS, behind which one can put anything, even
    stuff like Hybris, SAP. This is with what we started doing engineering 15 years
    ago.<p>2) Tailored web apps with heavy number crunching on the server - e.g.,
    we built the software analyzing all the weather data in Switzerland for the Swiss
    Metereology.<p>These kind of things bring in 60% of the revenue, this sector is
    increasing.<p>3) We are finishing building a SaaS product for Yoga studios in
    Zurich that can be adjusted to any business with a Business Process Management
    Suite, meaning that you can use and adjust it for the needs of hairdressers without
    having to write any code. 0% of revenue yet but this should change in Q1/Q2 2018.<p>We
    are always using the newest version of Java and the best tools available. Also,
    we aren''t against other stacks like Python or Clojure and don''t mind introducing
    new tools at all.<p>German is not needed as long as your English is good and you
    at least show willingness to learn German.<p>The interview process:<p>1) Phone
    screen<p>2) Coding task (skipped depending on first impression)<p>3) Onsite half

    companies refine their user acquisition and conversion optimization strategy.
    So they get more users. Who stick around longer and pay more. We have a moat of

    \ - Approach: We emphasize data — not brand voice. We care about conversion —
    not brand marketing. \n  - Prior knowledge: We will teach you everything about
    advanced growth tactics.\n</code></pre>\nWe need someone who already:<p><pre><code>
    \ - → Is personable and can bond with others over phone calls. This has to be

    \ - Is concerned about process and being efficient with their time. Automate,
    delegate, batch. \n  - Lets data decide instead of exclusively relying on hunches.\n
    \ - Is passionate about a long-term future in growth marketing (aka growing startups).\n
    \ - Is able to quickly connect dots and come up with creative strategies on the
    spot.\n</code></pre>\nWe operate unlike a typical agency. (I wish there were a
    better term than \"agency.\") We work with clients for a long time; we see them
    from start to finish. You'll get a front-row seat to some of the most interesting
    companies. We have a profound impact on our clients' businesses and product roadmaps.
    They listen to us. Because we have built a moat of data and tactics that others
    have not figured out. (I personally learned a lot from previously running growth
    for Heap and Webflow.)<p>I have a hunch that A) operations/product leads, B) sociable
    engineers, and C) salespeople looking for something more than sales calls will

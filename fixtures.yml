  text: Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Onsite<p>Academia.edu
    is addressing two problems:<p>- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic
    pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal
    here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate
    how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last
    few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this
    means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90%
    of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility
    crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to
    indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to
    upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded
    about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia
    each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the
    way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph
    of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the
    academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the
    basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the
    basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge
    and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We
    have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True
    Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet
    from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe
    Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."<p>We are looking
    to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails,
    Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information,

    Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsite
    Right now the market for educational software is a mess. It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale. School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing. Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze. We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform. Our goals are much bigger than that, though. We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of about 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React. More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href="https://clever.com/about/jobs" rel="nofollow">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a> !

    and statistical learning (\"data science\") team of the largest e-logistics company
    in South East Asia.<p>Likely useful experience:\n- Software development (aside
    from building actual software, you'll need to read a lot of code to understand
    systems whose logic is not at database level).\n- A mathematical bend, including
    awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (\"predicate

    If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation
    values and variables, we are probably on the same page.\n- Knowing your way around
    PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure
    teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.\n- At least some enjoyment of the
    resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to
    quick hacks and duct tape.\n- UNIX/Linux, but if you've read that far you probably
    have more than enough experience. \n- Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit
    but the team has multiple native speakers.<p>Interview process:\n- Email vanessa.tan@lazada.com
    to be sent a few quick questions. Include \"6h9mYszLTq2Y\" in the subject line
    so we know you're not a bot.\n- An hour or two over Skype for probing your technical
    experience.\n- An hour or two in Singapore (if you are there) or over Skype for
    the C-levels to figure out if they can work with you."

We are looking for pragmatic engineers who communicate well and get things done. We like to ship things fast and iterate quickly. Our stack is AWS, Postgres, Rails, jQuery, Bootstrap, and React.

    Atlantic Media | Washington, DC | Junior UI/UX Designer | Fulltime | ONSITE<p>Hey all, my company is looking for an entry-level designer to help redesign one of the organization's B2B media sites (<a href="http://www.govexec.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.govexec.com/</a>). We don't have nap rooms or catered lunches, but it's a great place to work, benefits are solid, the people are nice, and the project will have some unique and interesting challenges (some good, some bad).<p>The role isn't on my team directly, but I personally think this is a cool opportunity for a more junior person looking to break into web design and development. I also love that we're opening some positions to more junior people (taking to heart an article from a few weeks back about The Death of Junior Positions)<p>If any of you know someone with a good creative eye (if not a ton of experience), or someone who loves the idea of designing for media, feel free to pass on the link!

    with your colleagues to make iterative improvements.<p>* Our open source web application
    framework for developing information rich applications extends from a low level
    search engine up to high level UI components, along with everything in the middle.<p>*
    Our work is a bit different. We went to the effort of developing our own platform

    away from the relational model and built server side JavaScript APIs. Our platform
    is mature and incredibly effective at building applications to manage semi-structured
    information — and easy to extend and evolve to handle new requirements.<p>* You’ll
    be a leading voice in shaping our development practises. We build highly customised
    applications with lots of business logic on top of integrated products, and our
    API design and development processes must enable this to be maintainable and sustainable
    in the long term.<p>* We care about quality and doing things right. We know that
    doing things well means we can move faster, and so have minimal technical debt
    and legacy code. You’ll be making improvements and driving us forward, supported
    by a leadership team who will reduce scope, not quality.<p>* It’s an exciting
    time to join. We’re market leaders in our niche, and expanding out into related
    products. You’ll have the excitement of building new things, within the stability
    of a company with a proven business and enviable reputation.<p><a href="https://www.haplo-services.com/jobs/senior-developer"

    focused on data-driven decisions and making smart capacity investments for the
    future. We're one of Boston Business Journal's Best Places to Work (again!).<p>Recruiting
    for multiple roles, especially:<p><i>Platform engineer (including technical lead)</i>
    - Build all our core systems (including interesting architecture/scaling problems),
    working on a well-documented code base in a team with a strong review culture
    and very clear communications. We use a Java/Hibernate stack; happy to get applications
    from people with experience in comparable technologies.<p><i>Front-end engineer</i>
    - Build all our member-facing applications including Jobcase.com, working mostly
    in Ruby on Rails. Drive the member experience for acquisition and social network
    features, working closely with product management and design/UX.<p><i>Quantitative
    data analyst</i> - Own a slice of our business metrics and drive member acquisition
    and engagement. Send email/SMS communications, work with engineering to build
    new flows and features, and come up with experiments to optimize the member experience.<p><i>Data
    science / machine learning / information retrieval (experienced)</i> - Help our
    members find relevant advice and jobs, and our colleagues make good decisions.
    Have a direct impact on revenue and on engagement, working with a team that's
    making major optimizations for our members and with colleagues who are uniformly
    data-savvy.<p>Interview process is a phone screen, then onsite interviews, with
    onsite design exercise and/or take-home coding/analysis exercise. Happy to answer

    is an digital agency creating mobile apps, VR/AR interactive experiences, and
    we are just about to release our first Nintendo Switch game. Which is to say we
    do fun and interesting stuff.<p>We are now looking for a senior Unity and C# developer
    to join us. Our team is still small - you''d be employee no. 10. What this means
    is that we still operate in WYSIWYG mode - the correlation between your actions
    in the workplace and the outcome is clear and discernible. The role comes with
    a wide range of tasks, high degree of responsibility, and an ample amount of freedom.<p>A
    bit about you. You probably earned some kind of diploma in computer science or
    a game-related field (unless you’re a self-taught savant). Afterwards you’ve meticulously
    honed your craft in various established organizations for half a dozen of years
    or so. In addition to great products, over time you’ve also built your set of
    soft skills. You can not only solve problems but also communicate your solutions
    to others. You may have been exposed to stuff like office politics and ladder
    climbing, and rightfully decided you want nothing to do with it. You prefer to
    disseminate knowledge rather than gossip. And somehow - almost miraculously -
    deep inside you still feel the fire to write clean code, make smart game design
    decisions, and lead younger team members with a smile.<p>Basically we want you
    know your shit, get shit done, and not be a shit to others. It’s a tall order,
    for sure, but you’ll get to work with people who exude those qualities as well.<p>This
    is a full-time salaried position in Toronto. (Un)fortunately we don’t have a legal
    team so we can’t help you with getting a visa - you need to be able to work in
    Canada for this one. Send your resume to ivan@seedinteractive.co (n.b. we are
    big believers in one page CVs) and write a few sentences why are you the best
    person for the job so we know that you care (and could judge your persuasion skills
    and spelling).<p>TL;DR: Unity & C# senior dev lead who’s also a jolly good chap'

    writes a blog post announcing it to the StackShare community. From there, they
    spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer.
    Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group
    of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to
    production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that
    matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we''re building a product
    for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest
    them and giving them ownership over these products.<p>Interview process:<p>Phone

    or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours --
    you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement
    there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else
    the training/time investment doesn''t make as much sense from your end or ours.
    When each interview is done, you''re done.<p>I know the above might sound a little
    strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup
    that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily
    first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction
    of their engineers'' time interviewing; we help take the load off. We''ve done
    a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could
    write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with
    us, clients love working with us, and we''re well-funded and growing quickly as
    a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we''re looking to hire more
    Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written
    and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience.
    Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training
    you before you even start, so if you''re strong technically and love working with
    people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat,
    using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers
    who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top
    tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to
    work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road
    tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero
    to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather''s like.<p>The
    application form is here: <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&lever-source=HNWH"

    know it''s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email
    me at josh@karat.io and I''m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S. We''re also
    hiring for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior engineers, dev
    managers, and a product manager right now; for those we generally prefer local
    (Seattle) candidates, though we do cover relocation. More details on those here:
    <a href="https://karat.io/careers" rel="nofollow">https://karat.io/careers</a>,

    papers with ML, implementing new ranking algorithms for authors and journals.

    of REMOTE for someone brilliant<p>Daisee makes software for call centre operators
    to transcribe calls, and then do various kinds of analysis on the call text (e.g.
    whether the caller was expecting a call back, general sentiment of the call, predictors
    of a successful or unsuccessful call). We also help call centres offload voice
    volume on to chat. We also do predictive modelling for demand (not just in call
    centres: retail as well).<p>We are a well-funded startup with a long runway to
    support our current 20 staff. We''re making large $$$$ sales into enterprises
    most weeks. We have mature management (two ex-googlers are on the management team,
    including the former Australian general manager; the rest of the executive team
    have held senior roles across the banks, successful startups and a variety of
    other major corporations). You get the stability and mature culture of a large
    corporate job, but the interesting work and dynamic environment of a startup.<p>We
    have a team of data scientists already; I''m looking to hire one more, preferably
    with skills in computer vision.<p>I am looking to hire around 3-5 software developers
    to take on various projects. There are existing projects in Python, but we are
    seriously considering switching to Go or Haskell for the bulk of future development.
    (If you are only interested in a Haskell role, or only interested in a Go role,
    just mention it in your resume.)<p>What I would like from a software developer
    is a lot of experience of working with data scientists and/or some machine learning
    skills yourself. Having taken projects through to production and supporting them
    there is also valuable.<p>The call centre application is the most important one,
    so experience with NLP, Twilio and call centre software (e.g. Genesys) will get
    you to the top of the resume pile. On the other hand, if you are happen to have
    some knowledge around point-of-sale systems, forecasting, stock and warehousing
    systems and so on, that will get you to the top of the resume pile for the demand
    modelling part.<p>I also need some devops folks: in particular, we have a platform
    that helps speed data science projects through the cycle from jupyter notebook
    -> software development -> in production system; I''m looking to hire someone
    who can own that product and provide insight into what production problems could
    be avoided by baking things into code at an earlier stage in development.<p><a

    we are<p>We''re a not-for-profit team that builds open-source educational software
    for communities with limited or no access to the Internet. We believe in the transformative
    power of learning, and are passionate about social justice and breaking down barriers
    that prevent people from reaching their full potential.<p>We started 5 years ago
    with KA Lite (<a href="https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/" rel="nofollow">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/</a>),
    an offline-installable platform bundling Khan Academy content and our own student
    tracking tools, which is being used in nearly 200 countries and territories.<p>We''re
    now in the process of releasing our second-generation platform, Kolibri (<a href="https://learningequality.org/kolibri/"
    rel="nofollow">https://learningequality.org/kolibri/</a>), which empowers users
    to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content,
    both online and offline. We''re building tools for authoring videos and exercises,
    an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features
    for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local
    network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and
    systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners. On the backend, we use
    Python/Django, and on the frontend we use Vue.js and (in one project) Backbone.js.<p>We
    recently received significant funding from Google.org to support our work (<a

    and our team has doubled from 10 to 20 full-time staff in the past year. We''re
    now building out further to support new initiatives, including a project for refugee
    education with UNHCR, and to continue to build towards our longer-term vision.
    It''s an exciting period of growth, both for our team and for our impact, and
    there are lots of ways you could make a difference!<p># Who you are<p>You care
    deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning,
    strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (<a

    Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent<p>We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!<p>Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.<p>We currently have these opportunities:<p>- As a /Head of Digital Product/, you’ll take over from our CEO in keeping all our development efforts incredibly well organised and delivering the vision. You’ll grasp our strategic vision, consult with stakeholders to prioritise and specify desired developments, and co-ordinate the work of our agile development team to balance our editorial, development and commercial goals and deliver them with maximum efficiency.<p>- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.<p>- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.<p>- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.<p>- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.<p>- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.<p>All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
    All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.<p>If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. <a href="http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/</a>

We need your engineering ability and your desire to be a part of the whole product!<p>I’m a manager on the Online Checkout (that’s the “Pay with PayPal” button and experience) engineering team. We're looking for experienced JavaScript developers. My team is currently working primarily with Angular on the client and Express/Kraken on Node. If you've got experience with GraphQL or React, we're actively exploring doing an inside-out migration of our application and could use your expertise.

    Senior Front-end Software Engineer | Full Time | $150k-$225k<p>Who we are: We
    are a small company loathe to use the word “startup”. The phrase that most aptly
    describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select
    software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone
    product in about 6 months. The future product will focus on enabling business
    workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach
    balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves
    well and support our vision for the future. We''re looking to get one final person
    in place to help us build our product, and that is hopefully you.<p>We are incredibly
    selective (who isn''t?) and we are really quite small. We''ve blogged about our
    hiring process and we''ve blogged about our funnel. The reality is we''ve optimized
    our hiring process to filter first, before a call. We''re sorry this is the case;
    it would be really nice to meet everyone, but we simply don''t have the time to
    do that while also working on our business. We try to be as transparent as we
    can be about our process, but if it doesn''t work for you we''d love to hear from
    you when we''re bigger and having a recruiting division who will be able to do
    a call first approach. We have a vision of a product but we don''t have one yet,
    so we can''t point you to it. Sorry!<p>Also, we''re forthright about this (see
    the first line of this post) but we really and truly only hire employees authorized
    to work in the US. We''re not large enough to want to deal with non-US tax jurisdictions,
    and we''re not looking for 1099 contractors at this time.<p>Who you are: An incredibly
    motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine
    on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard
    front-end technologies we don''t. You are a self-starter who can work with little
    supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get
    things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You
    should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because
    you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet
    understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.<p><a

    Full Time<p>IDEO Palo Alto is in search of a Software Designer who will leverage
    an understanding of software to design and deliver innovative solutions that address
    core user needs. We count on Software Designers to inspire teams of the possibilities
    enabled by software, computing, and programmatic thinking, providing unorthodox
    ways to push design. They first-hand enact our mission of humanizing technology:
    starting from first principles to ask the right questions, of people, technology,
    and systems.<p>One or more below could be your focus areas:<p>- Physical/Digital.
    You’re a Creative Technologist who works with software and hardware to create
    connected installations, experiences, and augmented objects. Your skills may include
    electrical engineering, micro-controllers, sensors, creative coding, or robotics.<p>-
    Emergent Interactions. You’re a pioneering Software-meets-Interaction Designer
    who works with emergent edge technology to explore new interactions at the frontier
    of what’s possible. You’ve dabbled, but have focus in a specialization ranging
    from computer vision, to chatbots, to augmented/mixed reality, to blockchain.<p>-
    Digital Product. You’re a rare user-centered Engineer/Designer/Unicorn. You bring
    strong front-end skills with full stack potential to craft product, aligning user
    needs and client objectives. You understand web or device-native development,
    along with the iterative agile dev process, and how to position products for scale
    and impact. You have a secret crush on business design.<p>- Digital Immersion.
    You’re an Illusion Technologist, crafting intangibles like “feeling,” via code.
    You guide people across the uncanny valley by working with software to create
    immersive experiences, games, or interactive narratives. You can reach deep into
    the inner nature of physics and computer graphics, and apply that to 2D/3D or
    VR, with tools like Unity.<p>- Computational Design. You’re a Generative Technologist.
    A pattern recognizer. A problem classifier. You works with algorithms or simulations
    to crack challenges that humans alone can’t compute. Your toolkit of tactics may
    include procedural design, machine learning, or neural networks.<p>As a Software
    Designer in Palo Alto, we provide the opportunity for you to: - Participate in
    the full design process, from talking with users to identifying potential opportunities,
    to delivering a great software product. - Solve problems in a broad set of domains,
    ranging from health, consumer technology, and mobility. - Explore and develop
    concepts with emerging technologies, such as new user interaction technologies,
    computer vision, or machine learning.<p>Want to know more about this role? Please

  text: 'Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA Full Stack Engineer, Infrastructure
    Engineer, Mobile Engineer, Success Coach<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves.
    We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify”
    to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome
    work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you
    fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches.
    But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even
    when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright
    sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need
    you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug
    reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>-
    A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust,
    rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in
    a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the
    most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and
    night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either:
    every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while
    having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal
    and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to
    go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work
    at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to
    figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might
    bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven
    data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some
    new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant
    in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>-
    Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!).
    You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is
    always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch
    on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL
    — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can
    just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know
    what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more,
    but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying.
    That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard
    and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other
    applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first
    favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally
    overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to
    do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which
    you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com" rel="nofollow">http://we.are.expensify.com</a>)
    or email us at jobs@expensify.com. We are excited to hear from you!'

    2: We need someone to write a simulator and improve blockchain explorer tools
    to determine how well Monero''s privacy claims truly hold up. To-date there is
    no public research on fundamental aspect of Monero. We want to be able to have
    answers to the questions of how private a user becomes when using Monero. How

    am a big fan of beautifully designed software which are well crafted, end-to-end,
    keeping the intended users in mind. In my opinion, a software should be designed
    to work like a good appliance; easy to setup and operate, with minimal to no intrusion
    and predictable in behaviour.<p>I believe crafting a good software which fulfils
    the aforementioned goals requires careful planning, execution and concerted symphony
    within the team. Keeping the said in mind, I continuously strive to hone my craft
    by exploring and learning best possible tools and technology for the job at hand.
    I am also inclined towards growing as a software engineer by constantly enhancing
    my understanding of fundamental concepts and tooling.<p>I have over 7 years of
    experience working as a Software Engineer. I also have experience working as an
    independent consultant.'

They understand that growth comes from action, not talk. They rely on me not just to provide guidance but to execute—to make decisions, implement systems, lead teams, push code, talk to users, launch campaigns, analyze data, and do whatever else it takes to get results.<p>2. They want to get the right skills and insights on their side. Having worked with dozens of B2B tech companies—from seed-funded startups to the world’s largest telecom company—and having tested hundreds of strategies, tactics, and tools, I know what works, what doesn’t, and how to do things right.<p>Send me an email (greg[at]gkogan.co) or read more at <a href="https://www.gkogan.co" rel="nofollow">https://www.gkogan.co</a>.

    =================================<p>SEEKING FREELANCER<p>Remote: Yes / Location: Finland<p>=================================<p>| imageboard software | security | sysadmin | Looking for an experienced programmer to make a private community website that consists of customized imageboard and user authentications to discord. It would be targeted to a smaller audience so no competition for other boards... i need someone trustworthy who can show previous work, is interested in the project and can guide with learning the imageboard software/server maintenance. Server must be optimized, secured and taken care of atleast until i learn all the necessary tasks or find a second admin. For an expert these shouldn't be too demanding and none of the coresystems have to be programmed from scratch unless the person wants to but shared imageboard software like <a href="https://github.com/fallenPineapple/NPFchan" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/fallenPineapple/NPFchan</a> , <a href="https://github.com/kennell/imageboards" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/kennell/imageboards</a> can be used as a base or model. Im able to cover the costs of the server and have a suitable place for it.<p>CONTACT: ren0[at]protonmail[dot]ch<p>The features would be as simple as possible and all the unnecessary stuff disposed of. In addition to the basic imageboard features we would need:
    - An application system: Admins and moderators can accept or reject applications.
    Accept: Send a welcome email with a link to create the user.
    Reject: Send a comment about the application in email and offer a chance to edit it/try again.
    - Privatecommunity: cut off all connections to the board if the user is not logged in. Frontpage would have info about the site, login form (+ password retrieval), links to the application and discord server.
    - Administration: Easy page to manage applications, reported posts, users, bans etc.
    - Discord authentication: Users should authenticate to the internal discord channels / role automatically or manually so that when the application is accepted there would be instructions in the account settings on how to do it for example. a command with a discord bot or something like that.
    - Mobile compatibility
    - Generate invite codes or links for individual or X old users that can be used to register without application.<p>This is not all, but the most important ones.<p>Budget is 500€ but note: this is not for someone doing the usual paid work. This is for someone who is interested in the project, wants to help and possibly learn something in the process.<p>Our purpose is to create a private community type imageboard with a support network that can also help people dealing with depression, social alienation and mental health problems that are increasing globally especially in the youth.

    $70-100/hr. Expert Interviewer at Karat (<a href="https://karat.io" rel="nofollow">https://karat.io</a>)<p>Work
    from anywhere in the world that has a solid internet connection. Work as much
    or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours --
    you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement
    there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else
    the training/time investment doesn''t make as much sense from your end or ours.
    When each interview is done, you''re done.<p>I know the above might sound a little
    strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup
    that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily
    first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction
    of their engineers'' time interviewing; we help take the load off. We''ve done
    a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could
    write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with
    us, clients love working with us, and we''re well-funded and growing quickly as
    a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we''re looking to hire more
    Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written
    and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience.
    Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training
    you before you even start, so if you''re strong technically and love working with
    people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat,
    using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers
    who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top
    tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to
    work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road
    tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero
    to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather''s like.<p>The

    hiring for full-time roles for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior
    engineers, dev managers, and a product manager right now; for those we generally

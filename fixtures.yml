If you have seen what physicians have to put up with, it's a bad version of the 90s, and makes medical care worse and more expensive for everyone. We are a group of previously successful engineers and entrepreneurs (MIT, Dartmouth, Datapower, Stripe, Salesforce, etc) and senior doctors (John Hopkins, UCSF, etc) who are determined to finally fix this.
    Compensation: market salary & equity -- we are well funded.

    Who we are: We are a small company loathe to use the word “startup”. The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.

    We are hiring experienced data scientists to change the way eBay does advertising. eBay's old advertising strategy was 3rd party focused (Ads that sent people off eBay). Our CEO said that strategy has changed. We need ads that keep people on eBay and offer better choices for our buyers. We are the team blowing up the old strategy and doing something better. You can move the needle when it comes to eBay's profit. We are a small team in a growing remote office. This is a unique opportunity to learn search engine and recommendation technology which rank eBay's 1+ billion active items. We apply cutting edge machine learning techniques on petabytes of data and thousands of Spark/YARN nodes. This includes deep learning, XGBoost and online learning. Our interview consists of two phone screens. Then you come onsite to meet the team and do a code test. The role will be 50% production coding and 50% research.
